    <div>The basic idea is simple, look at the code directly to recap.</div>
    <div>
      Manual routing is very basic, it does not even change url in browser.
    </div>
    <div>
      Hash routing changes the URL in the browserâ€™s address bar changes, but
      only the hash part...
    </div>
    <div>
      The third example is to use `page.js` to do client side routing, which
      relies on the browser History API
    </div>
    <div>Of course, there are other libs to use for routing...</div>
  </div>
