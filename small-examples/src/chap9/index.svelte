  <h1>Chap 9: Client side routing</h1>

  <div class="example">
    See examples in these repos:

    </li>

    <p>The basic idea is simple, look at the code directly to recap.</p>
    <p>
      <mark>Manual routing</mark> is very basic, it does not even change url in browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      <mark>Hash routing</mark> changes the URL in the browserâ€™s address bar changes,
      but only the hash part...
    </p>
    <p>
      The third example is to use <mark>`page.js`</mark> to do client side routing,
      which relies on the browser History API
    </p>
    <p>Of course, there are other libs to use for routing...</p>
